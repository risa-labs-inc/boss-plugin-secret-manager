/**
 * Adapts the host's [BrokeredCredentialProvider] onto the plugin-local
 * [BrokeredKeySource] seam.
 *
 * This adapter keeps host API types out of the credential store even though they predate
 * the manifest's 1.0.89 floor. The boundary still makes the store independently testable
 * and limits an incoherent host installation to AI settings registration. See AGENTS.md.
 *
 * Returns null when the host has no broker relay at all, so the caller can leave
 * [ProviderCredentialStore.brokeredKeys] unset and have brokered providers report
 * unconfigured rather than failing.
