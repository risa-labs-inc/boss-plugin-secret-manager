/**
 * The local agent CLIs, as this panel needs to see them.
 *
 * A plugin-local mirror of the AI Gateway's `AiCliSessionAPI`, and the types below mirror its
 * types, for exactly the reason [WireFormat] gives for not using `LlmApiFormat`: referencing
 * a new-api symbol from the panel's own code puts it on a path that runs whenever the panel
 * loads, so a host serving an older api jar would fail to link the whole settings page. Every
 * such reference stays inside the one adapter that implements this, which is created inside a
 * `LinkageError` guard - so an older host loses the Local CLI section and keeps everything
 * else.
 *
 * It exists at all because a CLI engine cannot be a [ProviderDescriptor]: there is no
 * endpoint, no credential, and nothing for the user to paste. What it offers is the auth they
 * already have - a `claude` or `codex` login from a terminal - which is why it is a section of
 * its own rather than a row in the provider list.
