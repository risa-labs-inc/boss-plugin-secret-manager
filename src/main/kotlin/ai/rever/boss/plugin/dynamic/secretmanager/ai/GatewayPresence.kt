/**
 * Whether the AI Gateway plugin is here, and how to offer to install it when it is not.
 *
 * **Why the AI section needs this at all.** `AiProvidersUiState.cliEngines` is empty in three
 * situations the panel used to treat alike, on the stated grounds that "none of them gives the
 * user anything to do here": the gateway is absent, the gateway predates `AiCliSessionAPI`, or
 * this host's api jar cannot link the symbol. That was wrong about the first one. A user who has
 * signed into `claude` in a terminal and comes here to use that login sees no Local CLI sessions
 * section, no explanation, and no way to find out that one plugin stands between them and it.
 *
 * The other two really do leave nothing to do, which is why this asks about the **plugin** rather
 * than reading the empty engine list: an installed gateway serving no engines is a different fact
 * from an absent one, and only the second is actionable.
 *
 * **There is deliberately no install call.** No plugin-facing api installs a plugin, and none
 * dispatches a deep link either, so Install hands a `boss://` URL to the OS - which owns the
 * scheme and routes it back into this same instance, through `SingleInstanceManager`, to the
 * Toolbox's deep-link handler. That handler shows a modal confirm naming the plugin **from the
 * store** and installs on the answer. It exists so a web page can offer Install without being
 * trusted about what is installed, which makes it the right door for a plugin that cannot be
 * trusted about it either.
 *
 * Ported from `user-secret-list`'s `SecretManagerLink`, minus the part that does not apply here:
 * that plugin's floor is 1.0.20, so it had to probe reflectively for `openPanel` (api 1.0.57).
 * This plugin's floor is **1.0.73**, so `openPanel`, `PanelEventProvider`, `PanelId` and
 * `PluginLoaderDelegate` are all below it and are called straight. A guard there would be dead
 * code implying a risk that cannot occur.
