/**
 * The Local CLI section, and the one invariant it exists to hold: **exactly one thing is
 * active**.
 *
 * The gateway resolves a disagreement in the engine's favour - a selected engine wins over any
 * configured key - so a stale HTTP preference cannot misroute a request. What it can do is make
 * the panel show a provider as active while requests go somewhere else, which is why each
 * setter clears the other and why that is tested from both directions.
